# POMDPMusic
Simple MATLAB implementation of "Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes for Interactive Music Systems", Martin et. al. (2010)

Created as a course project for CSC2515 - Decision Making Under Uncertainty. 
Created in a bit of a rush, so its not as advanced as I would have liked. I'll likely go back to this at some point and improve it a bit, there's some pretty obvious and easy improvements to make.

Uses Ken Schutte's Matlab-Midi library, which can be found [here](https://github.com/kts/matlab-midi)
